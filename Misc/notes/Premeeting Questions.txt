Can we get some example data?
What are the average/max input currents/voltages?
What kind of sample rates and sample resolutions are ideal for you?
Your diagrams show 4 sampling locations within the harvesting circuit, would it be possible to reduce this to three points?
Do you need the data to include the time, so that it can show when the experiment started/ended?
